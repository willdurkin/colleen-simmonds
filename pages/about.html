					<p>Colleen began her career in fashion and retail, taking on senior roles at Gap Inc and J.Crew for more than 10 years before starting her own interior design firm in 2011.  Working with many of the retail 'greats', she developed her appreciation for fine fabrics, beautiful pattern and color, and the art and commerce of putting it all together.</p>
					&nbsp;
					<p>The starting point for every project is the same: what the space wants, and what the client wants.  Using these guiding principles, Colleen creates interiors that are sophisticated but not serious.  Colorful but never chaotic.  Stylish and clean while also warm and welcoming.  A special focus is clients with young children (like her own!) where practicality combines with panache.</p>
					&nbsp;
					<p>After more than 15 years of big city life in San Francisco and NYC, Colleen moved back to her hometown of Pittsburgh in 2017 where she happily resides with her husband Henry and two boys, John and George.  Colleen is a graduate of Duke University.</p>
